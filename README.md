# AEQUOR

Aequor is a visual landscape representing the sea levels of Planet Earth. It examines hidden secrets beneath sea level to unmask, not only the present and future models of nature, but the unnoticed past we are not discovering through history. This piece allows the viewer to overtake the biological and physical world that creates an exploratory portraiture of human’s dominance on nature. The geological transformations are triggered with collected data from the Pacific Ocean. Each motion demystifies the climate change in a high-speed metamorphosis. With Planet Earth evolving slowly on a visual scale, human beings cannot immediately witness geological modifications. Aequor allows the participant to acknowledge a change of environmental composition with sea data that feed into the landscape which enlightens the evolution process.

The participant controls and transforms the environmental state of this oceanic perspective. This piece aims to build an experience that provides an amplified connection between humans and nature. Individuals become controllers of the landscape transformations with different hand gestures. The viewer emerges as an agent affecting the geological structure that questions our mode of exploitation of nature.

The artwork is meant to push the boundaries of human being’s connections to nature in a way that we tend to become less reliant on climate change, while our affection to nature grows indirectly. Correspondingly, the user’s interaction with the landscape allows discreet movements that transform the biosphere with information, matter and energy.

**Aequor** creates an exploratory adventure that holds the organic life as a reactive transmission, calculation and storage of environmental materiality.
